# 🛡️ CodeSafe

**CodeSafe** is a lightweight static analysis tool that scans source code (Python/JavaScript) for common security issues like SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, and insecure deserialization. It’s tailored to beginner codebases and explains each vulnerability in plain language, helping developers understand and fix security flaws in their code.

Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, CodeSafe is the perfect tool for early-stage developers looking to improve the security of their projects without overwhelming them with complex security jargon.

## 📌 Features

- 🧑‍💻 **Static Code Analysis**:
  - Scans Python and JavaScript source code for vulnerabilities
  - Detects issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), hardcoded secrets, and insecure deserialization
  - Supports multiple file types (Python `.py`, JavaScript `.js`, etc.)

- 📝 **Plain Language Explanations**:
  - Each identified vulnerability comes with an easy-to-understand explanation
  - Describes why a vulnerability is dangerous and how to fix it
  - Provides code examples to demonstrate safe coding practices

- 🔒 **Security Issue Detection**:
  - Detects common beginner mistakes like improper input sanitization
  - Highlights areas with potential for hardcoded passwords, tokens, and sensitive data
  - Flags insecure practices like unsanitized user input or weak encryption methods

- 📊 **Detailed Reporting**:
  - Provides a summary of vulnerabilities detected in the code
  - Lists vulnerabilities by severity and impact
  - Suggests concrete remediation steps for each issue

- 🚀 **Easy Setup & Integration**:
  - Works out of the box with minimal configuration
  - Can be integrated into existing development workflows (IDE plugins, CI/CD pipelines)
  - Designed for beginner-friendly usage with a straightforward command-line interface (CLI)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: None (CLI-based tool)
- **Backend**: Python (AST for static analysis), Node.js (for JavaScript analysis)
- **Security**: Basic vulnerability detection patterns (e.g., regex for common mistakes)
- **Storage**: Local (no external storage by default)
- **CLI**: Python `argparse`, Node.js CLI tools
